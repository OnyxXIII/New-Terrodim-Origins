# New Terrodim Origins

These Origins have been developed for the [Minecraft Origins mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) for use by the players on the New Terrodim Minecraft Server. Origins were suggested based on what the players wanted to play, as well as the fantasy races that were represented in roleplay and build style on the old Terrodim Minecraft Server.

Origins:

- Dragonborn
- Dwarf
- Elf
- Faun
- Human
- Naga
- Pirate
- Sea Elf [deprecated]
- Wharf Rat
- Wizard

You have my permission to use these origins in your own server, copy and edit them for your own origin development, or do anything else you would like with them - with or without credit.

Warnings: If you use this datapack for yourself, please be aware of the following limitations:

- Due to a limitation in the Origins mod as it stands currently, the Pirate power enabling double TNT crafting required disabling the Minecraft TNT recipe and replacing it with a power for all other origins that provides a (identical to the default) recipe. If you are removing an individual origin for your own use, you will likely want to remove the tnt recipe in the minecraft/recipes folder, as well as the "ntorigins:tnt_crafting" power from the origin definition.
- This origin setup depends on the following mods:
   - [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins)
   - [Pehkui](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pehkui)
   - [Small Ships](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/small-ships) (for some Pirate powers only, though some tag lists preventing boat use also prevent use of small ships)
   - I also recommend [Towelette](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/towelette/files), as Naga cannot sleep without the ability to waterlog beds. The curse forge page isn't clear, but Towelette depends on [Statement](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/statement).
